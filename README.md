Kooling runs on all Android mobile phones with API 25 (Android Oreo) or higher

The application can be accessed through the Android Studio project folder by following these steps:

1. Open Android Studio on your computer.
2. Click on "Open" to navigate to the folder where the Android Studio project is located.
3. Select the project and click "OK".
4. Android Studio will build the project and download the necessary libraries. It may take some time for the project to finish building and be ready for running on an Android device.
5. Connect your smartphone to Android Studio. You can find more details on how to do it here:[link to developer.android.com/studio/run/device](link to # developer.android.com/studio/run/device).
6. Additionally, you can run the application using the built-in emulator of Android Studio if you prefer not to download it on your mobile device.

To achieve a lower API level, the group has chosen to retrieve time from the system clock. This means that the user must be in Norway or in the same time zone to get the correct result when the application fetches data from the APIs and calculates production.
You can also load the application with a set of premade turbines.You can access this in the settings, the last button "Laste inn testvinm√∏ller". NB this will delete other turbines you have placed.
